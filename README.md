# message_board_rest_api
a RESTful API for a simple message board built with Django REST Framework

This project implements a RESTful API for a message board using Django
and DjangoRestFramework (DRF). The message board contains 3 resources:
Users, Threads, and Messages. Users are modified only by the site admin,
and are read-only to the outside world. Threads represent a collection
of messages. In addition to a list of messages, they have an owner and a
topic. Messages represent posts to the message board. They are organized
by threads. Each message contains a thread reference, an owner, and some 
body text representing the post.

Documentation
=============

Detailed Documentation along with access and modification capabilities
can be found here: <http://minds57.pythonanywhere.com/>

Authentication
==============

In order to make changes to threads and messages a user must log in.
Once authenticated, a user can only modify the threads and messages that 
he has created. No user can modify threads or messages from another
user. A user can, however, add new messages to a thread owned by another
user. For evaluation purposes please use the following credentials.

Username: admin

Password: password123
